## Cell Overview

Terminology:
- Cell Membrane 
    - edge of a cell responsible for all traffic into or out of a cell
- Cytoplasm 
    - Jelly that inside a cell that the organelles sit in
- Nucleus 
    - Holds the genetic material of a cell 
- Mitochondria 
    - Resplonsible for energy generation
- Rough/Smooth ER 
    - Store lipds/protiens
- Ribosomes 
    - Responsible for protien synthesis
- Golgi body 
    - prepare lipids/protiens for use, "packager"

## DNA/RNA

DNA:
- Polymer that encodes genetic information using ordered nitrogenous bases
- Has a phosphate sugar "bone" for structure
- Nitrogenous bases bond in pairs: Adenine to Thymine, and Cystosine to Guanine
- Complementary strands face in opposite directions 3' to 5' and 5' to 3'
- 3' and 5' are directions of the sugar phosphate chain based on bonding geometry

RNA:
- Single strand rather than pairs
- Has Uracil instead of Thymine as fourth nitrogenous base
- Has Ribose instead of deoxyribose as the sugar (ribose has 1 more oxygen)

### Replication
- Helicase unzips DNA strands into two strands leading and lagging

Leading strand (5'-3' direction):
- RNA primer starts the complementary chain
- DNA Polymer builds the rest of the chain

Lagging strand (3'-5' direction)
- RNA primer starts complementary chains many times because DNA polymer must work "backwards" along chain
- After complementary strand is built, RNA polymers are replaced and DNA ligase joins it all together

### DNA Transcription/translation
Each replication unit has a header and footer sequence to indicate the start and end of the sequence
RNA polymerase goes along chain and creates an mRNA chain which is a complementary sequence(U instead of T)

Finished mRNA strand is capped to protect it during transit

mRNA strand leaves nucleus and goes to rough er to be used. mRNA is an instruction set for protien/enzyme production

tRNA is then used to "read" mRNA and translate it into amino acids. 

tRNA has a 3 long sequence and a corresponding amino acid. mRNA is read in these 3 long chunks and the corresponding amino acids are attached to a chain. This chain is called a polypeptide

## Diabetes Over View
Insulin is released into bloodstream when sugar is present. Insulin bonds to cell receptors allowing them to intake sugar from the bloodstream
Types:
- Type 1
    - Autoimmune response kills insulin producing Beta cells. Reliant on insulin for treatment
- Type 2
    - Issues with receptor binding resulting in cells that are unable to get sugar from the bloodstream
- Gestational
    - Can occur during pregnancy, typically only lasts until delivery, subset of type 2

## Stem Cell Treatment
Islets are areas of pancreas that have hormone secreting cells
- A cells secrete glucagon
- B cells secrete insulin, C Peptide, and amylin
- D cells secrete somatostin which inhibits A and B cells
- F Cells secrete pancreatic polypeptide

Islet transplants can be done onto liver but have two main drawbacks:
- Require immunosuppressants to prevent autoimmune response
- Lack of donor material available

Stem cell method allows for material to be grown from a patient's stem cells solving the supply issue. 
Additionally by using the patient's stem cells there isn't an immune response to the transplant
Finally, the autoimmune response can be prevented by protecting the cells with a porus "bag"
